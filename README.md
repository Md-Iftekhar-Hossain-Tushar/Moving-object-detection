Passive infrared (PIR) sensors are motion-detecting devices used in security systems across the world -- even though you may not see them, they probably see you!
This is a simple to use motion sensor. Power it up and wait 1-2 seconds for the sensor to get a snapshot of the still room. If anything moves after that period, the 'alarm' pin will go low.![image]

PIR Motion Sensor Overview
PIR sensor's are infrared-sensitive light detectors. By monitoring light in the infrared spectrum, PIR sensors can sense subtle changes in temperature across the area they're viewing. When a human or some other object comes into the PIR's field-of-view, the radiation pattern changes, and the PIR interprets that change as movement.
That white cap dominating most of the top side of the PIR assembly is a lense, which helps focus the PIR sensor's field-of-view. The actual PIR sensor is hiding under that lense:
